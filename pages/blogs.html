      <h1>How To Apply Perfume Oils & Attars The Right Way?</h1>
      <img class="section__blog__img" src="/images/assets/1.jpg" alt="perfume_spray">
      <p class="content__p">The Attar is a perfume variant that provides an overpowering experience. As the name
        suggests, smelling it instantly transports you to a flower valley. You might think that perfumes and attars
        are
        the same
        because they are both fragrances, but they are very different.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
          <br>
          Attar is a pure perfume oil derived from botanical sources, primarily flowers such as rose, jasmine, and
          sandalwood, as well as spices, herbs, and barks. Often perfumes on the market contain a high percentage of
          alcohol, i.e. up to 95%. As a result, their pure fragrance oil content is only a tiny percentage of 5-20%. On
          the
          other hand, Attar is a pure perfume free of alcohol and chemicals.
          <br>
          Attars are uniquely formulated, so there are different techniques and tips to apply them correctly that make
          them
          last all day long.
          <br>
          Apply Attar on your pulse points
          Generally, Attar is to be applied on some specific points to get the best results. The pulse points are where
          you
          should focus your attention. These are the warmest parts of the body that heat up quickly, such as the neck,
          chest, shoulder, wrists, and inner elbows. The fragrance tends to spread as the temperature increases. With
          Attars, little goes a long way so that a small amount can cover a large area. You can choose one or two among
          these areas to focus on. If you are new to Attars, the wrists and neck are the best places to start.
          <br>
          Layer Attar on top of unscented deodorant
          Deodorants are designed to control body odour, which occurs naturally when you sweat. Floral deodorants may
          feel
          refreshing in the summer, but when combined with your favourite musk-scented Attar, the combination becomes
          pungent. It will irritate your nose all day and annoy those around you. This is where unscented deodorants
          come
          to
          the rescue. They control your body odour while not interfering with your Attar fragrance.
          <br>
          Choose an Attar with a higher concentration
          Understanding the ratio of fragrance oil to alcohol allows you to determine how long the fragrance will last
          on
          your skin. Eau de perfumes contain a higher concentration of fragrance oil that can last up to 5 hours,
          whereas
          Eau de toilettes are less intense and can only last up to 3 hours. On the other hand, attars have the highest
          concentration of fragrance oil and no alcohol whatsoever; hence, they last anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.
          <br>
          Remember to use Attar on your clothes
          Spraying perfume directly on your clothes is an easier way to make them last longer. In the summer, you can
          apply
          Attar on your shirts or tunics and your coat or leather jacket in the winter. To apply attar to your clothes,
          rub
          your hands together with the Attar. As a result, your perfume oil will cover a large area, and your clothes
          will
          not be ruined. If you’re using a dark-coloured Attar, you should test it on your clothes first.
          <br>
          Now that you know how to apply Attar, go to the “Attars” section and choose from a variety of superb exotic
          and
          luxurious Attars that you will adore! There’s a fragrance for everyone at Al-nuaim.

      <h1 class="heading__bg">How To Pick A Perfume That Suits Your Personality?</h1>
      <img class="section__blog__img" src="/images/assets/8.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="content__p">Did You Know that people create a mental image of your personality traits by how you smell?
        <br>
        Whether you’re doing a date night or working in the office, perfume gives them a certain aura about your
        charisma,
        sense of humour, or intelligence. Based on their interpretations, people will share their comforts and feel free
        to hang around with you.
        <br>
        Finding a fragrance that suits your personality can be a daunting experience. While buying a perfume, the only
        information you can garner is the brand and appearance of the bottle. Often, the salesperson will let you sniff
        a<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
          few selections from the hundreds of available options, which is not really of that much help.
          <br>
          Here are a couple of easy tips from fragrance experts to help you find the perfect scent that makes your
          personality traits & gives you a sense of confidence.
          <br>
          Do Some Research
          <br>
          First & foremost, it’s important to research different brands, scents, and their formulations. For instance,
          if you like spicy or woody fragrances, try to put them on yourself for a week or two. If people around give
          you
          compliments on your preference, that scent might be your signature style.
          <br>
          Also, it is important to select something that makes you feel comfortable & good about yourself.
          <br>
          Learn More About Your Skin Type
          <br>
          It’s incredibly imperative to first identify your skin type before testing some perfumes on yourself. If you
          have
          sensitive skin, a strong formulation might cause rashes or irritation on your body. Hence, it is advisable to
          apply something light and soothing.
          <br>
          On the other hand, for dry skin types, people can choose musky or aromatic notes to stay all day long for the
          fragrance.
          <br>
          Pay Attention To Perfume Notes
          <br>
          There are three perfume notes: top, heart, and base. The top note evaporates quickly but gives a flowery and
          sweet
          smell. Likewise, the heart note stays for an hour or two and is mainly carried by people who have frequent
          official meetings. It helps them look fresh and active.
          <br>
          The base note supports the heart note and stays for a longer time. Usually, athletes or on-field professionals
          should wear this note to feel confident and fresh.
          <br>
          Select The Right Concentration
          <br>
          Perfumes are available at different concentration levels. For instance, high-concentration scents are strong
          and
          long-lasting. Usually, it is preferred by an individual who possesses strong personality traits. It is simply
          called ‘parfum’.
          <br>
          A medium-concentrated perfume is mild and lasts for six hours. Mostly, it is preferred by extroverts and
          outgoing
          personalities. It is known as ‘Eau de parfum’.
          <br>
          The lowest concentrated perfume lasts for three to four hours. It is chosen by teenagers or people who carry
          them
          on special occasions. It is known as Eau de toilette.
          <br>
          To Conclude:
          <br>
          Indeed, a perfect scent can define your personality and truly become an extension of yourself. It takes
          patience
          and the right approach to pick the best perfumes that suit your style!

      <h1 class="heading__bg">‘Attar vs Perfume’ – Key Differences You Should Know</h1>
      <img class="section__blog__img" src="/images/assets/3.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="content__p">Traditional Attars may be a new concept for many due to significant surge in its demand in
        recent
        years, but they indeed have ancient history. In this new decade of the 2020s, it is predicted that Attars will
        be
        more in-demand due to various factors like people’s shift towards organic cosmetics, long-lastingness,
        eco-friendliness and over saturated modern perfumery industry.
        In this article, let’s try to figure out major differences between attars and perfumes, and which one you
        should<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        pick out of these two:
        <br>
        What is an Attar?
        <br>
        Let us get a basic idea of what exactly is an Attar. These are technically ‘concentrated perfume oils’, which
        in
        common language means, there is no presence of alcohol in them.
        <br>
        These oils are obtained from flowers, herbs, and spices. True attars are 100% pure and natural and there is no
        presence of any toxic chemicals.
        <br>
        The Attar market is huge in the middle-east and south Asian region, but they are now becoming gaining
        popularity
        on the western side of the world, especially in the USA, Canada, Australia, and European countries.
        <br>
        What is Perfume?
        <br>
        Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents. It also contains a
        mixture of alcohol, water and molecules that evaporates at room temperature.
        <br>
        What are the differences between Attars & Perfumes?
        <br>
        Difference Between Attar and Perfume
        <br>
        1. Attars are fragrances in ‘Oil’ form While Perfumes are ‘Spray’:
        <br>
        Attar perfumes are concentrated natural fragrances derived from botanical sources in form of base oil. While
        perfumes typically come in spray form as they contain alcohol.
        <br>
        2. Making Process:
        <br>
        Attars are derived using traditional hydro-distillation method on base of Sandalwood oil. Raw material used in
        distillation process comes from plant parts such as its roots, flowers, leaves etc.
        <br>
        Perfumes are created using attars or essential oils, alongside some other perfume ingredients/synthetic
        molecules
        and alcohol.
        <br>
        3. Natural Vs Synthetic
        <br>
        The major difference between Attars and Perfumes is that Attars are nature-based and Perfumes are
        chemical-based.
        <br>
        Attars are made from things like Flowers, whose smell is more comfortable for our senses. Perfumes are made
        from
        chemicals that sometimes may be harmful to our skin and overall health.
        <br>
        4. Eco-Friendly
        <br>
        Perfumes, when mixed in Air, or Water will pollute the air around us and our oceans, while attars are
        bio-degradable and friendlier for nature when compared. We have discussed in detail the side-effects of
        synthetic
        perfumes here.
        <br>
        5. Projection
        <br>
        Certainly alcohol molecules help perfumes have better projection in comparison to attars.
        <br>
        6. Cost:
        <br>
        True Sandalwood based attars are costly due to labour intense process required to produce them. They are also
        rarely available thus are highly priced commodity.
        <br>
        While some niche perfumes and designer perfumes can be highly priced, you can find many cheaper alternates in
        market.

      <h1 class="heading__bg">Basics of Natural Perfumery – Guide for Beginners</h1>
      <img class="section__blog__img" src="/images/assets/5.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="content__p">Perfumes are part of human history for a very long time. Evidence has shown that since the
        times of
        Egyptian civilization, perfume has played a vital role in the humans’ lifestyle.
        <br>
        Deemed as a luxurious possession by many Kings in the past, flaunting by privileged people to showcase their
        rich<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
          lives and used in many therapies for relaxation of mind, Perfumes will always be considered as ‘something
          special’.
          <br>
          What are Natural Perfumes?
          Natural Perfumes can be defined as a product made from several raw materials, used to produce a pleasant smell
          by
          spreading its molecules in the air. The raw materials used for making it can be flowers, herbs, spices, barks
          or
          sometimes animals. Usually, many different materials are mixed for a single perfume.
          <br>
          Since they are derived from botanical sources, their fragrance is completely pure & natural and smells light
          and
          refreshing for our olfactory senses. On the other side, Commercially produced scents are more toxic and
          stronger
          in smell.
          <br>
          How are Natural Perfumes Made?
          In natural perfumeries, these ‘special scents’ are made by mixing up various organic fragrances and essential
          oils, with a fixative or solvent. Essential oils are extracted from different natural sources to provide their
          fragrance, whereas fixatives are used to make the scent last longer.
          <br>
          Raw Essential Oils are highly concentrated and are recommended not to be applied directly. Thus, they are
          diluted
          to a certain extent. The process to obtain them from their sources is usually through Steam distillation,
          Expression or Solvent extraction method.
          <br>
          Since they are very volatile, fixatives are added to provide longevity and making it linger more in the
          atmosphere.
          <br>
          The process of making them is very challenging and thus are more costly and not easy to find in our world.
          <br>
          In India, these natural perfumes are called ‘Attars’, manufactured using the same age-old technique devised
          400
          years ago using traditional equipment.
          <br>
          Notes of Perfume Scent
          Different essential oils are used in the composition of natural perfumes, which are constructed based on
          ‘notes’
          used to prepare it. Commonly 3 notes are defined- Top, Middle, and Bottom. They are differentiated on their
          volatility rates, meaning how much time they take to evaporate.
          <br>
          The formulation of any natural scent is based on these three notes used in making it.
          <br>
          Top Note (Head)- They have high volatility and get evaporated usually in the first 30-40 minutes. These are
          very
          strong and sharp in their aroma but also refreshing in nature. They make up 10-30% of the blend.
          Middle Note (Heart)- Less volatile then top note, their odor is observed after the top note is evaporated.
          This
          one describes the primary theme/aroma of the perfume. 40-50% of the blend is made up of this note.
          Bottom Note (Base)- Least volatile out of three, this one is evaporated slower than others. These have a deep
          scent and stay active for more than a day. 15-30% of perfume comprises this note.
          A blend is then composed by fusing different essential oils, each having a unique essence, by an expert to
          maintain a balance of all notes, resulting in the beautiful scent which is loved by many. These blends are
          then
          diluted to reduce their intensity. Sometimes they are also left for aging, giving them some time for a perfect
          blending of all the ingredients.
          <br>
          Also, these natural perfumes should not be exposed to heat, oxygen or light. This would either make them
          evaporate
          fast or result in a chemical reaction that will change the perfume’s personality. It is best to keep them in
          dark
          and in a cooler condition of about 5-10 degrees Celsius.
          <br>
          It is always better for humans to be close to nature. Natural perfumes are not only pure & non-toxic but also
          are
          eco-friendly and cruelty-free. They have many stress-busting and mental relaxation properties as well. In a
          time
          when life is getting busier, these perfumes will be our best gift by mother nature.
